# Implement issue

## Overview
Pick up a Linear issue, implement the required changes, and update the issue status when complete.

1. **Retrieve and understand the issue**
   - Use Linear MCP to get the issue details
   - Check if the issue is already completed or in progress by someone else
   - If so, ask the user if they want to proceed anyway
   - Read the issue description, acceptance criteria, and any sub-issues
   - Review related code files and context

2. **Plan the implementation**
   - Identify the files that need to be modified
   - Determine the approach and any dependencies
   - Ask the user for clarification if anything is unclear

3. **Implement the changes**
   - Update the issue status to "In Progress" on Linear using Linear MCP
   - Make the necessary code changes
   - Follow best practices and coding standards
   - Ensure code is clean and well-documented

4. **Test the implementation**
   - Run existing tests if applicable
   - Test the feature manually using browser tools if it's a web application
   - Verify that the implementation meets the acceptance criteria
   - Fix any issues found during testing

5. **Update the issue**
   - Add a comment to the Linear issue summarizing what was implemented using Linear MCP
   - Attach screenshot as proof if applicable (if the issue is related to frontend)
   - Update the issue status to "Done" or "In Review" as appropriate
   - Include any relevant details like files changed, approach taken, or notes for review
