# Linear MCP Usage Rules

## Linear MCP Operations
- The agent is permitted to use Linear MCP tools (mcp_Linear_*) for reading, creating, updating, and managing Linear issues, projects, teams, and other Linear resources.
- Linear MCP operations are external operations that interact with Linear's API and do not modify the local codebase.
- When using Linear MCP tools, the agent should NOT make any changes to files in the codebase unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Linear MCP operations are considered safe operations that only affect the Linear workspace, not the local repository.

## Codebase Protection
- Using Linear MCP tools does not require or justify making changes to source code, configuration files, or any other files in the repository.
- If a Linear MCP operation is requested, perform only that operation without modifying any local files.
- Do not create, update, or delete files as a side effect of Linear MCP operations.

## Examples of Allowed Operations
- List, read, create, update, or delete Linear issues
- Manage Linear projects, teams, cycles, and labels
- Search Linear documentation
- Query Linear resources and metadata
- All other Linear MCP tool operations

## What NOT to Do
- Do not create or modify code files when using Linear MCP
- Do not update configuration files when using Linear MCP
- Do not create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Do not make any file system changes as part of Linear MCP operations
